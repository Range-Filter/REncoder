# REncoder

## Introduction
REncoder is a novel range filter. It improves the performance of range queries by ruling out empty range queries. REncoder organizes all prefixes of keys into a segment tree, and locally encodes the segment tree into a Bloom filter to accelerate queries. REncoder supports diverse workloads by adaptively choosing how many levels of the segment tree to store. The experimental results show that REncoder is 4.6 times faster than the state-of-the-art on average, while remaining the same accuracy.

## About this repo
- `data`: test dataset, generated by workload 
  - `key.txt`: keys of the data
  - `lower_bound.txt`: lower bound of range queries
  - `upper_bound.txt`: upper bound of range queries 
- `src`: codes of REncoder
- `worload`: codes for generating dataset
- more details can be found in above folders.

## Requirements
- SIMD instructions are used in REncoder to achieve higher speed, so the CPU must support AVX-512 instruction set.
- g++

## Build and Run
- `bash make_all.sh` to make executable files
- `bash run.sh` to generate dataset and run REncoder(SS/SE) on the dataset
- `bash test.sh` to test the correctness of REncoder(SS/SE) 
- `bash clean.sh` to clean dataset and executable files
